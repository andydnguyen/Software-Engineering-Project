# Software-Engineering-Project

This is the general README file for the Software Engineering class. If you are new to the project or just starting out, please keep reading.
This project is based on the first Option, analyzing system logs for the Osprey network, and presenting that data with a GUI interface. 
The .ppt defines the project description as: "The customer needs software to visualize and analyze system security logs or network data captures, to profile access, and look for intrusion attempts and unusual behavior."

Therefore, the project, at the very least, must have these features:

[*] A GUI interface
[*] An ability to load data into the program, read in from a text file
[*] An algorithm that profiles different people who are trying to access the Osprey server
[*] An algorithm that looks for intrusion attemps and determine unusual behavior. 

Each of these abilities will be fully fleshed out. The project has not yet been decided in which direction it will go, regarding web based
or application based.
